<p> EAST COAST   VS   WEST COAST<P> </div>

<div class="a"><p> Former LAPD dedective Graig kading has investigated both murders and provided evidences that had the real story of both incidents. On Sep 7th, 1996 Rapper Tupac Shakur and The Death Row entourage who are associates of the MOB Piru's gets into a fight with a member of the South Side Crip Orlando Anderson. Tupac starts the fight by punching Orlando, then the MOB went off. Tupac went to the Hotel knowing that he will be going to the club 662 which owned by Suge Knight CEO of Death Row record label.</p></div>

<div class="b"><p> Many people have talked about why Tupac attacked Orlando Anderson, like Napolian, ex member of the Outlaws said that Tupac had to get into the fight because Orlando was trying to snatch a Death Row chain which costs $10000. After they got out the hotel, Tupac decides to go in the car with Suge Knight instead of his security. He also decided to not wear his bulletproof vest because 'it was hot that day'. On their way to 662 club, Suge stops on a red light on East Flamingo Road and Novel street and all of the sudden a white cadillac pulls up right next to Suge's car and started shooting. Tupac and Suge both were shot in that drive-by, however Tupac was in a very dangerous situation. </p></div>

<div class="c" ><p> Suge was hit once in the head, but he was concious, however, Tupac got hit 4 times, once on the arm, once in the tigh and twice in the chest. Unfortunetly, one of the bullets went inside his lung and doctors couldn't take the bullet out so they had to take-off his lung so he stays with one. He remained unconcious from that day until September 13th where he passed away. Suge knight have seen the shooters, but he refused to cooperate with police. Furthermore, in March 1997 Biggie Smalls was shot also in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles. Hip-Hop industry reccognizes that these two murders are very connected due to the fact that Badboy label (Biggie's) and Death Row (Tupac's) were in a serious conflict which was knowing later as the East Coast West Coast war. Moreover, Biggie's mother decides to sue the LAPD for her son's murder and the LAPD had to pay about 400 million dollars, therefore, LAPD decides to finally solve Biggi's case but not Tupac's, but because they both are highly related, therefore Kading decided to go back to Tupac's murder and start from the begining. When Kading worked with old files that contains unsure informatiom he was able to figure out a suspect who was in the white cadillac during the shooting. This person called Kefi-Di who is Orlando's uncle and a member of the South Side Crip as well. Kading was smart, instead of arresting Kefi-Di for it (which will never work because there wasn't enough evidence to prove, so Kading informs Kefi about multiple dope and gun charges and if Kefi provides information on the Tupac's case then he will get away with is recent charges. Kefi agrees to confess about that night and Kading was recording:</p></div class="f"><p>
"Was that a rented Cadillac?" dedective.
"Yeah" Kefi-Di.
	
<div class="f" ><p> "Who rented that cadillac?"
"T-Brown"
then Kefi keeps going "We went to eat..we was eating..hearing they just beat up Lane (Orlando Anderson) .. there were a few New Yorkers though with Zip". So now Zip (New York Goon) asks "Man ya'll need some help?" Kefi says "Nah we got this".<p></div>

<div class="e" ><p>Sean Puffy Combs who's a CEO of Badboy records offers a million dollar to kill Tupac and Suge Knight according to Kefi, and that's when Zip said:
    "That's a perfect opportunity baby" 
Then the dedective asks "That's because of what happen to Lane". Kefi answers "yeah".
    "Fuck that shit, what Tupac think this is, we gang bang out here" a random gang member.</p></div>

<div class="e"> As a retaliation. According to Kading, Suge Knight has paid 25 thousands dollars to murder the Notorious B.I.G. Suge was in jail when Biggie died but evidences shows how Suge paid his wife 12 thousnads to deliver the other13 thousnads to the hitter of Biggie. In kading's interviwe regarding his documentary "murder rap" he confirms:
